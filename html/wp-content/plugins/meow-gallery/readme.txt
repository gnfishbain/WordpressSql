Gallery system built for photographers, by photographers. Clean, focused, evolves naturally. Uses the Masonry layout by default.

== Description ==

Meow Gallery allows you to easily enhance the native WordPress gallery, making it responsive, retina, and using modern layouts. Because a demo is worth a thousand words, have a look at this page using the gallery [Haikyo: Nara Dreamland](http://haikyo.org/nara-dreamland/). And here is another page using a smaller gallery at the end of an article: [Offbeat Japan: Nichitsu](http://offbeatjapan.org/nichitsu-ghost-town/).

**LAYOUTS.** The gallery comes with popular layouts: Masonry, Justified (like Flickr) and Instagram (square images). More will come depending on the trends, ideas and your requests :)

**FEATURES.** This gallery uses the WordPress gallery system naturally without hacking it, or without imposing its own system. It means you can use the Meow Gallery without any fear, your WordPress will not be forced to become independent of it. The gallery is **responsive, light and fast**. We will never make it overblown with options and features.

**COMPATIBILITY.** Since this gallery works with WordPress in a natural way, it should be compatible with any other plugins or themes (of course, it depends on how those have been exactly implemented). Of course, it has been tested with [WP/LR Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wplr-sync/) attributes if you wish to link your galleries with your Lightroom's collections.

**LIGHTBOX.** We believe that choice of the lightbox depends on you, so this gallery doesn't come with one. We however recommend you to use the [Meow Lightbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/).

You can find more information on this plugin on [Meow Apps: Meow Gallery](https://meowapps.com/meow-gallery/).
