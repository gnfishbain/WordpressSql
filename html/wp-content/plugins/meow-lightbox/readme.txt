Lightbox built for photographers, by photographers, with EXIF information and more.

== Description ==

Lightbox built for photographers, by photographers :) If you want to see how it performs, have a look at one of my post on my website, for example this one: [Best Abandoned Places in Japan](http://offbeatjapan.org/best-abandoned-places-2014/). Or with a gallery, in that case, any page on [Haikyo.org](http://haikyo.org). And here is the official page: [Meow Lightbox](https://meowapps.com/meow-lightbox/).

**IMPORTANT**. By default, the selector is set on '.entry-content'. If your theme doesn't use it, you need to update the plugin options. The plugin will then look for images surrounded by links and apply the lightbox. When you insert images in your posts, make sure the "Link To" is set to "Media File" or to "Attachment Page". For more information, please check the official page.

**KEY FEATURES.**
- Responsive Layouts. Looks great on mobile, tablets and bigger screens.
- Responsive Images. Image resolution itself will adapt to the screen and device.
- Display Image / EXIF information. Shutter speed, aperture, camera, lens.

**PRO**. Pre-loading and *display a map* for images with GPS coordinates.

**GALLERY.** We believe that choice of the gallery system depends on you. We however recommend you to use the [Meow Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/).

**BETA, PLEASE HELP US**. This plugin is fairly recent. So we need your feedbacks to improve it. We will keep it simple, nice and powerful. We however don't want to bloat it with too many useless or heavy options. If it's not working for you, please don't get angry, because we need your help. Talk to us, we are here, and willing to help :)
